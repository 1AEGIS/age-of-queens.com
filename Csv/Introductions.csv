I work in the field of economics.I am smiling, I like to laugh, to joke, I try to treat life with humor and positivity. I am smiling, I like to laugh, to joke, I try to treat life with humor and positivity. Always open to new acquaintances. I am a keen person, so I have many different hobbies. I went to art school as a child, but then I dropped out. Although I still love to draw, but now I prefer to do active sports: dancing, in winter - snowboarding. I met the Age of Empires game as a child, my dad played it, and I sat next to him and watched))) that's how my love for this strategy was born. I started playing this game a year ago, I saw that my friend is playing Age of Empires II DE and decided to try again too. This is the best game, I have a special love for it.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_gcbAJWr4D6VqMpHm_pwCS-djQGtRsSU,,,,
21.06.2021 16:57:14,MagnoliaAoE,"I received Age of Empires with my family's newly purchased Microsoft computer back in 1998.  My sister and I quickly became addicted.  My obsession with Age of Empires evolved when Age of Kings came out, and eventually I began playing online multiplayer (MSN Zone) during the summer of '02.  . I was hooked on DM Franks War. Deathmatch was always my favorite and still is. I played off and on over the years on Voobly.  In 2017, I found myself between careers and with the spare time, I decided to start streaming on Twitch, playing the HD Edition.  Nomad TGs was my go-to and still one of my favorite maps!
Outside of AoE2, I love getting outside to hike, bike, and paddleboard.  I am lucky to live in Colorado where there are plenty of lakes, trails and delicious beer!",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ImRnd3e3-RQbfx6MxhcJDxc-DTJmLny7,https://twitter.com/lvlagnolia,https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlajbDQTXA6ZIfYkGZgXuK7cAWtOw7HVX,https://www.twitch.tv/magnoliaaoe,https://www.instagram.com/magnolia.aoe2/?hl=en

Furthermore, she is a passionate streamer on Twitch who has been playing a variety of games for over 4 years.

23.06.2021 16:20:37,Yekky,"I started playing aoe2 in 2000. It was an on and off thing, and at one point many years passed before I decided to get back into it, and drag my partner into it as well. My first online multiplayer game was in 2017 on HD on steam. I quit playing for a year and then got back into DE as soon as it was released. After that I was introduced to the community through watching streamers on Twitch. I think for all its flaws, the age of empires community is one of the best out there, it can be a wonderful community and I was lucky enough to meet many awesome people in it. I'm particularly fond of the Age of Queens sub-community, the aim of which is to empower and support women who play age of empires 2 and I'm happy to be part of an admin team of women who are so passionate about the game and the community. I can say that I am proud of the way in which our little community of women from all over the world is evolving, and that is why to me it felt worth introducing to everyone who plays this game, so I founded the Age of Queens clan server in 2021, in the hopes that it would be a public platform for us women, and our voice in the larger age of empires community; a  place that can grant everyone access into our tournaments and events whether to watch, cast, or even sometimes partiticipate, and to promote our members: streamers, content creators, mod creators, campaign creators, and players, in a supportive environment for women. I'm very excited to see our community continue to grow and I can't wait to meet more wonderful women who like us, love this game.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=17yXtYzuz7IgLLUXbC84t9qelFxLRKZgI,https://twitter.com/Yekky8,,https://www.twitch.tv/yekky,https://www.instagram.com/yekky_aoe/

I am happy and honored to call myself one of the very first members of AoQ as well as their Twitch Team! Hereby, I am keen to support and push forward the equality and visibility of women in Age of Empires. In my Twitch streams and Youtube videos I am playing fun teamgames with guests and communities as well as try to improve with coachings and deliver help content for my fellow low elo people out there! For the future of AoQ, I hope we will be able to further grow the community of all these amazing ladies and work together with events and actions to make equality and tolerance normality.
