Queens' Charity Clash,"Age of Queens is happy to present Queens' Charity Clash: A fundraising event featuring a series of Ao2:DE showmatches played by women during Women's History Month. Teams will each represent one of two charities that support women, Girls Who Code or Feminist Frequency, in a month-long showdown for top donations! Players will compete individually or as a team to score points for their charity. All money donated by you the viewer will be split between the two charities based on points the players earn. Everyone who donates will essentially be supporting two organizations, but will the one you're rooting for come out victorious?",,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/820324234001252402/948626125104492565/White_Inspirational_Reading_Book_Quote_Banner_14.jpg,,,,,,,,
