Age of Queers,On Saturday 26th of June at 21 GMT we will be celebrating Pride Month in a special way. We are hosting our first public Discord stage event. Our fabulous speakers will be talking about their experience as an LGBTQ+ member of the gaming community. There will be the opportunity to ask questions and we hope to have a valuable dialog about these topics. I believe a conversation like this is important to raise awareness about the diversity of the community.,https://i.imgur.com/46fkHW8.png,TinyTriss,24.06.2021

Queen's Clash,This year we celebrated International Women’s Day with an epic battle. The 1v1 tournament Queen’s Clash was kindly sponsored and supported by World’s Edge. In this tournament 44 players competed against each other for a total prize pool of $5000. The tournament was played in two groups: 32 players played against each other in Silver League. The 12 highest rated players competed in Gold League.

Age of Queens 1v1 first edition,Not too long after our first tournament we hosted another one: Age of Queens 1v1 second edition. This time the format was Single Elimination and in total 23 players participated. League 2 was for players below 1.1k 1v1 elo. Players with higher elo were competing in League 1. This is an aspect that was always important to me in the community: I want people to be included and allowed to participate in the events regardless of their skill level. I have heard from a lot of players “I am not good enough to compete in a tournament.” and I believe events should always if possible be structured so that players can join in and have fun regardless of their skill level. Grouping the players together by skill level really helps to result in close games that are fun for everybody to play and watch. The total prize pool of the event was 150€.

Age of Queens 1v1 First Edition,"Originally, I thought Age of Queens would only be one event and I imagined that I would be hosting it as a 1v1 tournament for female AoE2 players annually. However, when I started contacting women of the community, most of them were thrilled about a server dedicated to them. The number of members increased quickly, and I noticed there was not only the need for one tournament. There was the need to get connected as a community. This is why the first edition of the Age of Queens 1v1 tournament will always have a special place in my heart. It is how it all started. In hindsight I have to admit not everything was perfect back then. With every tournament that the Age of Queens community has hosted we have modified the rules and improved them. I think this will be an ongoing process for a long time. I believe not too many people even heard about our very first tournament. Over time the movement behind Age of Queens became bigger and bigger. However, when I look back I am proud of what we did back then. It was a tournament with 25 participants playing in two Leagues. The format was double elimination. I think that is a lot of participants considering that the female community wasn’t very well connected yet and the prize pool was symbolic (in total 70 USD worth of steam gift cards). This is how it all began.",https://i.imgur.com/QfosgTN.png,TinyTriss,01.06.2021
